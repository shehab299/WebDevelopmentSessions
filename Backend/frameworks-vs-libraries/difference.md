- A library is a collection of pre-written code that you can use to perform specific tasks

- A framework also is a pre-written code that you can use in your programs 

So what is the difference? 

You might hear that the difference is that a library is just one library but a framework is a collection of libraries (more than one) and tools 
but that is not the real difference.

**The real difference is about the flow of control in your programs**


Traditional Programs: 

- you own the control flow of your program.
- you write the main structre 
- you decide when and where to call functions 
- And a library is just a set of functions that you can call them whenever you need


Using Frameworks:

You handout control of certain aspects of your applicaions to the framework 
and you plug your generic code in the certain places and the frameworks decide when and where to call your code

**This is the principle of Inversion Of Control**

The prinicple of inversion of control is not a design pattern it a design princple that can be implemented in several ways a callback is one example of IoC
