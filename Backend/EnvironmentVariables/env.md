# Environment Variables

They are set of (key-value) pairs info that are made available to a process by its parent


# How it works

1. Your operating system starts
2. It sets up global environmen variables since it is the global process
3. When you start a process the os (the parent process) make a copy of its environment variables and make them available in memory for the process
4. Let's demonstrate an example

-----------------------------

- start the shell
show all environment variables available

- Let's talk about the path variable

when you run cowsay from your terminal 
how does it find this program to run it?
